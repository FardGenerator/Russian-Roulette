With this script, you have a 1 out of 6 chance (just like a revolver) to delete System32. Also, you need to run this as Admin or else it won't work.
How to run it:
1. Install whatever version of python you like.
2. In the terminal, do: python [path to the script].
3. It should run and delete System32 1 out of 6 times.
